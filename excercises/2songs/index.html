      <h2>Deng Li Jun</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>When we immigrated to Canada, we lived in a tiny basement suite in NE Calgary. My parents always played deng li-jun’s “yue liang dai biao wo de xin” (the moon represents my heart) on the cassette. Deng li-jun was a Taiwanese singer and a cultural icon (because she bridged Taiwan, Hong Kong and other Chinese speaking countries through popular culture), and my parents listened to her a lot in the 80s and 90s. I don’t listen to her now but it kind of brings back immigration cassette-tape childhood nostalgia.</p>

      <h2>Se So Neon</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>I’ve been having many in-between stages in the past few years and in the summer of 2018 I was living in Vancouver, in-between my time in Montreal and Japan, in-between changing my name and gender pronouns to Le - he/they, and in-between many places physically and mentally. I feel like with music I tend to listen to the same song or the same band/artist on repeat for weeks until I get tired of it. And during this time I was listening to se so neon, a Korean indie rock band. Se so neon’s lead singer hwang so-yoon has the most mesmerizing voice and guitar solos, and the song “a long dream” filled that summer.</p>
